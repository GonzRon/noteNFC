# Security and privacy review

Status: design-phase document, 2026-09-14. Scope is the real Android attack surface of a
local-first app; nothing enterprise-grade is proposed.

## Threat model in one paragraph

The adversary is (a) anyone who can present an NFC tag or send an intent to the phone, (b) any
app on the same phone that can register a custom scheme or read exported components, (c) whoever
obtains a backup file or the phone's storage, and (d) the user's own mistakes. There is no
server, no account, and no multi-user sharing, so network-facing risk is limited to the optional
Todoist client.

## Surface-by-surface analysis

| Surface | Threat | Control | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NFC payload** | Malicious or malformed record makes the app crash, misroute, or execute something | Tags carry only an id. `NdefCodec` validates TNF, type, exact payload length (18 B), version byte, zero flags, hex charset for legacy; anything else is `Malformed`/`Foreign` and shown, never acted on. No string from a tag is ever used as a URI. Bounded parsing; extra records ignored. | 1 |
| **NFC dispatch** | Another app claims our external type | External-type filters are namespaced by our domain and an AAR pins the package; a competing claim only produces a chooser. On API 37 the dispatch activity is protected by `DISPATCH_NFC_MESSAGE`. | 1, 7 |
| **Tag writing** | Overwriting someone else's tag; writing while a screen you did not intend is open | Reader mode only on the Write screen; read-before-write; explicit confirmation when the tag holds a different noteNFC payload or foreign NDEF content; read-back verification; lock is opt-in with a warning. | 1 |
| **Deep links (`notenfc://`)** | Hijack by another app; injection of ids | Navigation-only: no URI performs a mutation (complete/snooze/postpone require an in-app tap). UUIDs validated by shape and existence. Custom-scheme hijack can at worst open the wrong app; nothing sensitive is in a URL. App Links would close this if a domain becomes available (D8 R-4). | 1 |
| **Outbound URI launching** | Stored link opens a dangerous scheme (`intent:`, `file:`, `content:`, `javascript:`) or crashes on a missing handler | `LinkLaunchPolicy` allowlist (`joplin`, `obsidian`, `logseq`, `http`, `https`) + one-time user confirmation for other schemes + hard block list; `ActivityNotFoundException` caught; `<queries>` for handler checks. The share sheet's text is parsed for a URI; raw text is never stored as a URI. | 1 |
| **Exported components** | Any app can start our activities/receivers with crafted extras | Only the launcher/deeplink host and the NFC dispatch activity are exported. Quick-action receiver and boot receivers are not exported and are addressed with explicit intents and `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` PendingIntents. No exported ContentProvider. Deep-link extras are ignored; only the URI is read. | 1, 3 |
| **Notification actions** | Spoofed broadcast completes a schedule | Actions carry a random per-notification nonce stored in-process/DataStore and checked by the receiver; receiver not exported. | 3 |
| **Todoist token** | Token theft from storage or backup; leakage in logs | `SecretStore`: AES-GCM key in Android Keystore (`setUserAuthenticationRequired` off — background sync must work), ciphertext in `noBackupFilesDir`; excluded by `dataExtractionRules`; never in exports; never logged; revoked on disconnect (token deleted locally; user told to rotate in Todoist). Token entry field is masked. | 5 |
| **Todoist content** | Task content edited remotely to inject links or forge completions | Remote content is data: displayed as text, never linkified inside noteNFC, never interpreted as commands. Only `checked`/activity-log completion events, `due.date`, the recurrence string (verified, never adopted), and `is_deleted` are interpreted, per D3 §8. A remote due date that disagrees with the canonical computation is corrected, not trusted. | 5 |
| **Backups** | Contain serials, purchase prices, receipts, locations, Todoist task ids | Explicit warning at export; optional passphrase encryption (AES-GCM, Argon2id/PBKDF2) as a NEXT feature; tokens never included; user chooses the SAF destination. Automatic snapshots stay in app-private storage. | 1, 7 |
| **Attachments** | Persisted URI grants leak documents to us longer than intended; malicious files | Reference grants are listed and revocable in the Documents settings; managed files are opened through system viewers (`FileProvider` with temporary read grants), never rendered by an embedded WebView. MIME sniffed on import; size cap configurable. | 4 |
| **Accidental data deletion** | Wrong tap deletes an asset with years of history | Archive-first UX; typed confirmation for hard deletes; automatic pre-delete snapshot; `RESTRICT` on parents with children; undo window for event deletion (soft-hold 10 s before commit). | 1–3 |
| **Database integrity** | Partial writes, FK orphans, corruption | One transaction per use case; Room-enforced foreign keys with explicit `CASCADE`/`SET NULL`/`RESTRICT`; WAL journal; `PRAGMA integrity_check` and a "rebuild derived state" action on the Health screen; derived tables always recomputable. | 1+ |
| **Auto Backup** | Google account backup exposes data | Keep it (it is a survival aid) but exclude the secret file and cache; document that it is best-effort and signature-bound. | 1 |
| **Logging** | Sensitive values in logcat | No URIs, serials, or tokens in logs at INFO+; debug logging behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`. | all |
| **Dependencies** | Supply-chain risk | Minimal set (AndroidX, kotlinx, OkHttp); version catalog pinned; no analytics SDKs. | 0 |

## Privacy statement to include in the app

- No account, no server, no telemetry.
- Data leaves the device only when the user exports a backup, attaches a cloud folder, or connects
  Todoist (task titles, due dates, and a deep link are sent; measurements are not).
- NFC tags contain an opaque identifier only.

## Items deliberately not done

- Biometric app lock (nothing here is more sensitive than the phone's own lock screen; can be a
  NEXT setting).
- Encrypting the Room database at rest (SQLCipher adds size and complexity; app-private storage
  plus device encryption is the platform norm).
- Certificate pinning for Todoist (standard TLS is appropriate; pinning breaks on their rotations).
