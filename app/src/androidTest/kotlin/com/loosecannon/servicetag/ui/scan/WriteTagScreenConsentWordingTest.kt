/**
 * Pins the two write-screen sentences of the overwrite-consent flow, ratified by the owner
 * verbatim on 2026-09-17. They encode the consent invariant: the NFC handle that raised the
 * question can go stale while the sheet is up, so confirming discards it rather than writing
 * through it — the user must lift the tag off and hold it to the phone again. A future edit must
 * not soften that back into "keep holding the tag while you answer".
 *
 * `WriteStatus`'s `is WriteState.Confirm` arm draws the first sentence in an `NfcSheet`; the
 * second lives in a sibling composable, `OverwriteSheet`, which `WriteTagScreen` shows alongside
 * it whenever the state is `Confirm` (see `WriteTagScreen`'s `asking != null` branch) — no
 * interaction is needed to raise it, so both are composed together here, exactly as the screen
 * wires them, to pin both sentences in one tree. Both composables were `private`; this test
 * needed them visible to the androidTest source set, so both were changed to `internal` (no
 * logic change) — see the WS-1 report for the full accounting.
