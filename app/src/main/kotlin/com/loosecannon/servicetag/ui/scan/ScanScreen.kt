 * Foreground reader-mode scanning (D3 §9, G1 §1.4). The only `tertiaryContainer` surface in the
 * app sits here and the halo is the app's only animation; what a tag turns out to be is decided by
 * `ResolveTag` and shown on the result sheet.
 *
 * Reached as a pushed destination (Settings' Read / inspect tag row, or the dashboard's empty-state
 * action), never a tab (D12 §16 correction), so it always needs a way back.
 *
 * 2.7 (#37): the screen owns neither the reader-mode session — the nav shell holds one for the
 * whole tag flow — nor a route for its answer. The answer is drawn over this screen, so an inspect
 * never takes the screen out from under a tag that is still against the phone.
