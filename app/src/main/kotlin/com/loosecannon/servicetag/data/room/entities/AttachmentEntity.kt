/**
 * Schema v5 (spec §9.1). One row per attached file; the bytes are never here — they live in the
 * owner's SAF folder, and `storage_locator` is how to find them, relative to that folder's root.
 *
 * Two nullable foreign keys, exactly one of which is set: `asset_id` for a file on an asset,
 * `event_id` for one on an entry, both CASCADE so deleting the owner takes the row with it (the
 * *bytes* are `DeleteAsset`/`DeleteEvent`'s job, which read the locators before the cascade runs).
 * There is deliberately **no SQL `CHECK`** for the exactly-one rule (spec §11.5): Room does not
 * model one in its schema hash, so it would be invisible to migration validation. The rule is
 * enforced in [com.loosecannon.servicetag.data.room.requireExactlyOneOwner] on the way into the
 * table and in the backup reader on the way in from a file, the same shape as `nfc_tag`'s
 * at-most-one-target rule.
 *
 * `(storage_provider, storage_locator)` is unique: two rows must never claim the same bytes.
