/**
 * One chosen tree, as [SafAttachmentStorage] needs to see it.
 *
 * This interface exists so the storage resolver is testable at all: spec §5.3 asks for a
 * `rootResolver: (treeUri) -> DocumentFile?` seam, and a `DocumentFile` cannot be constructed in
 * a plain JVM unit test (it is abstract, and every implementation wants a `Context`). The seam is
 * therefore one level up — a resolver hands back an `AttachmentRoot`, production's is a
 * [DocumentTreeRoot] over `DocumentFile.fromTreeUri`, the device-proof suite's is one over
 * `DocumentFile.fromFile`, and a JVM test's is a hand-written fake.
